# Learnings

As always, the goal with the AoC is learning.
I’ll try to note down what was new for me everyday.

- Day 01: Quite a packed day !
    - I wasn’t super familiar with `NewType`, `partial` so I’m glad I had an opportunity to work with those
    - I often forget to use `zip` when working on several iterables so I’m glad I thought about it this time
    - `Counter` is something I discoved today !
    - Setting up `pytest`, `ruff` and `mypy` also isn’t something I do everyday, so a bit of practice never hurts

- Day 02:
    - I got to use `Counter` again
    - I discovered `pairwise`, very practical
    - I actually struggled quite a bit for part 2 because I skipped writing the tests at first and I tried to be too clever in part 1, which made my code way harder to change than it should have been. Serves me well !

- Day 03: Regexes !
    - Playing around with regexes is always fun (as long as their complexity stays manageable !)
