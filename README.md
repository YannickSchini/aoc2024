This repository will contain my solutions to the 2024 Edition of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) !

# Learnings

As always, the goal with the AoC is learning.
I’ll try to note down what was new for me everyday.

- Day 01: Quite a packed day !
    - I wasn’t super familiar with `NewType`, `partial` so I’m glad I had an opportunity to work with those
    - I often forget to use `zip` when working on several iterables so I’m glad I thought about it this time
    - `Counter` is something I discoved today !
